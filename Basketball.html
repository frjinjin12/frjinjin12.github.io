                      When I was 10, one of my friends encouraged me to take basketball classes with him. I had never played basketball before as soccer was my main focus and basketball was not popular in our school. My parents thought it was a good idea, because they thought I would grow taller, so they signed me up for classes. After a few classes, I started to enjoy basketball and I became really interested in it. I started regularly taking classes, and even recieved one on one training sessions with the coaches after classes. I worked hard and when I was off the court I researched and watched videos on how to get better. With this mindset, I began to improve rapidly. I was playing with kids two years older than me. I also played in multiple torunaments, even winning MVP.

                      In my first year playing for the team, we lost the championship and I had a disappointing performance. This motivated me to keep pushing for the following year. This year, I was selected as the team captain and led our team to a solid season. I played a lot better and I was even honored with MVP recognition and named to the All-Tournament Team. Unfortunately, multiple players on my team sustained an injury, which led us to be eliminated in the first round of our tournament.

                      Even though I was just a 7th grader, I was able to make the Highschool varisty team. It was a tough adjustment, because I was rather small compared to all the other players, but, even with this disadvantage, I helped our team acheive a huge accomplishment. Our team recently secured 2nd place in Acamis, one of the biggest tournaments for international schools in china. Despite being the smallest school with only 300 students, we faced off against much larger schools, with 2000-3000 students, including the 3rd ranked international school in the country in the championship game. Again, this was really tough for me, becuase of my height and size, but despite my limitaions, I played as the starting point guard even for our championship game. Unfortunately, our team was unable to win our final game and missed out the opportunity to become champions. This was still a huge achievement for us and we were proud of ourselves. Our team’s determination and passion really showed in the tournament.
